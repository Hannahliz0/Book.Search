# Book Search Engine

## Description
The Book Search Engine is a web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API and manage their saved book lists. This project refactors an existing RESTful API implementation to use a GraphQL API powered by Apollo Server. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), the app enables users to search for books, create accounts, log in, save their favorite books, and manage saved books seamlessly.
